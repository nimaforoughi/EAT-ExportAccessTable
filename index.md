# EAT-ExportAddressTable
EAT - Export Address Table diagram with the use of WinDBG

Steps as follow:

1. Retrive the DLL Base address by **lmf**
2. Retreive the Export Directory address by **!dh**
3. Parse the EAT

## How to retreive the DLL base address:

### WinDBG tool:
lmf

## How to retreive the Export Directory address:

		7-DWORDNumberOfNames;// Number of functions exported by name-  If this value is 0, then all of the functions in this module are exported by ordinal and none of them is exported by name.     
		8-DWORDAddressOfFunctions;// Export Address Table. Address of the functions addresses array.   
		9-DWORDAddressOfNames;// Export Name table. Address of the functions names array.  a RVA to the list of exported names – it points to an array of NumberOfNames 32-bit values, each being a RVA to the exported symbol name.      
		10-DWORDAddressOfNameOrdinals;// Export sequence number table.  Address of the Ordinals (minus the value of Base) array.

As Alice said:

> 3 fields are super important for us: AddressOfFunctions, AddressOfNames and AddressOfNameOrdinals
> Why ? Because when you call GetProcAddress on a function (let’s say A_SHAFinal) it goes like this:
>
> 1. The string “A_SHAFinal” will be searched in the array AddressOfNames (Export Name table);
> 2. When found, the position in the array is used to find the corresponding Ordinal number in the AddressOfNameOrdinals array (Export sequence number table).
> 3. Finally, the value of the Ordinals retrieved in the AddressOfNameOrdinals array is the index of the address function for A_SHAFinal in AddressOfFunctions (Export Address Table).

	Example: 

	The string A_SHAFinal is at position 0 in AddressOfNames.
	Then to retrieve the ordinal: AddressOfNameOrdinals[0]. 
	The value of AddressOfNameOrdinals[0] is 7.
	To retrieve A_SHAFinal function address we do AddressOfFunctions[7].
